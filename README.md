This is a cross-platform, fully MVVM [kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban). It is build using the [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) framework.

## Maintaining

Feel free to fork this or submit pull requests, but this is mostly a proof-of-concept/limited-use project for me so I don't plan on doing the work to make it a fully-fledged Trello-like app.
